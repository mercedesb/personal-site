# Overview

I started this project with the intent to make a personal website that actually represented me, not just my dev portfolio. I'm approaching this project as a learning process and as a vehicle for exposure to all facets of building a product. I intentionally will be tackling parts of this process that are not in my wheelhouse like concepting and design.

# Goals
- Create a cohesive brand
- Get exposure to and successfully implement basic design principles
- Learn basic Sketch skills
- Learn a new front-end framework

# Considerations

I'll be documenting my decisions and how I came to them along the way.

## Brand

#### Brand colors
I've always used kraft paper in my Etsy shop for my business cards and my packaging. I like it because it's understated, easy to customize, and affordable. It also has a long association with crafting and making. I want to bring this tone into my website to make it and my Etsy shop feel like an extension of the same person (because it is!).

I'm using kraft brown (#AA916D) as the starting point when picking brand colors.

#### Typography
Similar to using kraft brown as my brand color, I would like to use my Etsy logo's font face as a starting point for my site typography.

I chose Candela for my logo's font face because it is very readable and looks slightly handwritten without being too close to Comic Sans; it feels approachable. I like that it doesn't look perfect like many of the serif fonts tend to since I'm using it in branding for a shop where everything is handmade and no two items are the same.

My initial thoughts are to use Candela for my headings, and pair it with a serif font for the body copy.

The serif font faces I'm exploring are:
- Libre Baskerville
  - is the x-height too large when compared with Candela?
- Merriweather
  - also feels too large
- Domine
  - closer but still a smidge too tall
- Cardo

#### Tone
- confident but approachable
- fun but mature

## Information Architecture
Since the goal of a personal website is for the user to feel like they know me, I wanted the site to feel explorable and approachable. Because I want to emphasize exploration, I don't want to rely on global navigation. I don't want quick-click finding in this site (and it's so small that shouldn't be a problem).

This site isn't focused only on software dev, but also my fiber stuff so I want to surface the variety as much at the top level as possible. I also don't have a lot of content to start with so laying it out flat may make the site feel more complete.

I'm going to go with a broad, but shallow IA. I don't want to go more than 3 levels deep anywhere. In most cases, 2 levels should be enough.
  - Home -> Section -> Content (i.e. Home -> About, Home -> Blog List -> Blog Post)


## UX/UI
I initially jumped right into designing the site. I did one round of wireframes because I had in my head an idea I wanted to go with. Then I started with full site design. After 2 rounds of feedback, it became really clear to me that I didn't do enough exploration. So I backed up and started exploring colors in one page in Sketch, then I started a page for exploring typography, and a page for exploring home page layouts. I did this for every element of my site. I'm still working through all of those pages and haven't finalized anything yet, but it's helpful to keep track of all of the iterations and to separate colors from layout and each page's layout from eachother.

As I was exploring layouts I realized how hard it is to design a site without an idea of what the content is. I spent some time getting rough drafts of the main pages together so that I could build my design around that. It feels better than using Lorem ipsum because now I know about how long my intros/preambles are going to be and how much copy I will realisitically have on the page.

- Feedback (1st round)
  - move nav to top and follow expected mental pattern (desktop)
  - for inner pages, change the treatment to the content columns to clearly differentiate their purpose from the top level content columns
  - shorten the lines of text on content pages, 75 characters max (50-60 optimal)
- Feedback (2nd round)
  - colors still feel too saturated
  - even with different treatments, the columns don't feel right on interior pages. play with rows
