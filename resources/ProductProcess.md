# Overview

I started this project with the intent to make a personal website that actually represented me, not just my dev portfolio. I'm approaching this project as a learning process and as a vehicle for exposure to all facets of building a product. I intentionally will be tackling parts of this process that are not in my wheelhouse like concepting and design.
